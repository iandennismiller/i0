## The Intercept as an Estimate of Marginal Means

```{r gaussian_sim}
data(simulated_gaussian_data)
d = simulated_gaussian_data
d$x1 = as.vector(scale(d$x1, center=T))
d$x2 = as.vector(scale(d$x2, center=T))
t = target(y ~ x1 + x2 + x1 * x2, data=d)
summary(t)
plot(t)
```

## Example with Logistic Regression.

```{r logistic}
data(baylor_religion)
formula = religious.homophilly ~ centered.church.friends*centered.income
logistic.glm <- target(formula, family=binomial, data=baylor_religion)
summary(logistic.glm)                                                                   
plot(logistic.glm)
```
